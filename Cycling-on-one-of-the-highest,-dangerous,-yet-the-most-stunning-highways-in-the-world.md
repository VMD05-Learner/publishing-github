# Why Manali to Leh

What makes us travel and explore new horizons in life? What motivates us to be adventurous and tests the limits of our human spirit? Different people will answer these questions differently based on their lives’ current circumstances. We also had similar questions in mind when we planned our first unassisted bicycling expedition. When I say unassisted that means we did not take any support vehicle with us, stayed at roadside tents/dhabas, and took bare minimum cycle maintenance kit with us.

We chose to ride on this marvelous Himalayan road, which starts at Manali and ends at Leh. This interstate highway connects Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir states in India. It has the lowest altitude of approximately 6,000 feet and the highest altitude of approximately 17,300 feet. This mountainous nature of the terrain has divine beauty along with its larger than life challenges, such as heavy snowfall, landslides, strong wind, and Acute Mountain Sickness, just to name a few.

If this route is so risky, then why did we go for it? Call it passion for adventure, love for nature, or call it going into the unknown to search within, or simply call it a way to deal with mid life crisis.
